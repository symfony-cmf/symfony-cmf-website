  Main efforts last months focus on TreeBrowserBundle 2.0 and the related Sonata
  refactoring, and the ResourceBundle.

  Jackalope should see release 1.2 very soon, currently we are aware of only
  [one issue](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/pull/223)
  that needs to be fixed first.

  If you use Twitter, you might want to follow
  [https://twitter.com/SymfonyCMF](@SymfonyCMF) - we will tweet important news
  about the Symfony CMF on that account.

  # Development updates

  ## Decoupling Sonata Admin

  We are discussing about moving the [Sonata PHPCR-ODM admin classes into its
  own bundle](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/symfony-cmf/issues/216).

  This will decouple the the CMF Bundles from the Sonata Admin and clear the
  way for integrating other admin systems such as
  [ng-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin),
  [EasyAdmin](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle) etc.

  ## Routing Auto

  The RoutingAuto component now supports [DI container
  parameters](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/RoutingAutoBundle/pull/153) to be
  used as tokens and a
  [PR](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/RoutingAutoBundle/pull/150)  will soon be
  merged allowing users to register their own adapters.

  Also the URI generator now does some basic validation on generated routes.

  ## PHPCR-ODM

  PHPCR-ODM now supports a new "depth" mapping which allows you to map the depth of the underlying
  PHPCR node to a property in the document.

  It is also now possible to specify a custom locale chooser and configure the namespace alias used
  for translations.

  Support was also added to the bundle for [configuring
  Memcache](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrinePHPCRBundle/pull/184/files).

  ## PHPCR Shell

  Another Beta version of PHPCR-Shell will shortly be released, most notably it
  now supports updating fields with expressions in queries, enabling you to
  update fields based on other fields within the node for example.
