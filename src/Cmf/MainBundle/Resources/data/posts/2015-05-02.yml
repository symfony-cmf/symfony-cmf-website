  One of the result of the May [hackday](http://cmf.symfony.com/news/cmf-hackday-may-2015)
  was that we finally released [Jackalope 1.2](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/releases/tag/1.2.0)
  including new releases of the [Jackrabbit](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit/releases/tag/1.2.0)
  and [Doctrine DBAL](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/releases/tag/1.2.0) transports.

  All users should see performance and reliability improvements. This is especially true for users
  of the Doctrine DBAL transport where performance should have made a significant jump forward.
  Note that in order to use Doctrine DBAL transport in the new version you will need to update
  your database schema. Aside from this we also improved the maintainability and code-reuse
  between the transports. Of course we also always expand the test suite when we do any work
  on the code base. As we did fix several edge cases, it is recommend to review the CHANGELOG.md
  and UPGRADE.md when encountering issues after the update.

  At the hackday we also discussed about a more radical refactoring of Jackalope to create a
  [version 2 of Jackalope](https://github.com/jackalope2) that will be more modular and have
  a cleaner architecture, allowing better code reuse and performance. Adding new storage or
  search solutions should become really simple.

  We started drafting the concept in the [Jackalope2 wiki](https://github.com/Jackalope2/jackalope/wiki).
  If you want to get involved, please get in contact with us on the
  [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jackalope-dev) or in the Jackalope2 issue
  tracker on github.
