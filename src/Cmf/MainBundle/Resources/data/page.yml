                <p>
                    Welcome to the home of the <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a>
                    Content Management Framework. The project is organized by the Symfony
                    community and has several sponsoring companies and prominent open
                    source leaders implementing the philosophy of the
                    <a href="http://decoupledcms.org">decoupled CMS</a>.
                    You can read learn more about the project on the

                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    The Symfony CMF project makes it easier for <strong>developers</strong>
                    to add <strong>CMS functionality</strong> to applications built with
                    the <strong>Symfony2 PHP</strong> framework. Key development principles
                    for the provided <strong>set of bundles</strong> are <strong>scalability</strong>,
                    <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>documentation</strong> and
                    <strong>testing</strong>.
                </p>

            for symfony.com on the current state of the Symfony CMF project.
            He also mentions the work that Frederic Haddad has been doing leveraging the CMF for his clients that
            he illustrates in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Y5QPcYWHw">short video</a>. Looks
            like the Symfony CMF is ready for prime time!

            One of the fundamental ideas of PHPCR is that there can be multiple implementations that
            from an API act and behave exactly the same, but can be optimized for every different
            scalability and server requirements. We have been adding functional tests for the sandbox,
            but initially only tested using the <a href="https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit">Jackrabbit</a>
            based PHPCR implementation. In the past weeks we have now also
            <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox">enabled running the same tests</a>
            against the <a href="https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal">Doctrine DBAL</a> and
            <a href="http://midgard-project.org/phpcr/">Midgard</a> implementations. The key thing is
            that all we had to do was adjust the configuration, no code changes were necessary. This is
            the best validation of the concept of PHPCR possible! It proofs that the same code can run
            against now 3 different implementations of PHPCR!

              Thanks to the work of <a href="https://github.com/cryptocompress">cryptocompress</a> the Jackalope
              test suite for the Doctrine DBAL implementation now also
              <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal">runs with PostgreSQL and SQLite</a>!
              Previously it only passed using MySQL for storage. This is a major milestone as once you can support 3
              so radically different RDBMS there is little doubt left that we cannot easily support others too. More
              importantly this was all done in a very short time frame and we now have worked around many of the
              special gotcha's of MySQL. As a result we expect that adding support for other RDBMS will only
              take a minimal amount of time.

              There is still a fair bit of work to make the documentation complete. But the installation instructions
              should already be a big help in getting started. More importantly any new contributions will automatically
              show up at the above URL within a few seconds. However we have also setup a new repository to illustrate
              the bare minimum configuration necessary to run the CMF. As its can also be used as a starting point to
              create your own CMF project we have labeled it the <a href="http://symfony-cmf.readthedocs.org">CMF Standard Edition</a>.

              The pace of development has picked up quite a bit since the summer. One of the big things that finally
              landed in the <a href="http://cmf.liip.ch">demo site</a> is the integration with <a href="https://github.com/flack/createphp">createphp</a>.
              One of the big benefits of createphp is that it can help with generating RDFa output inside
              <a href="https://github.com/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox/blob/master/src/Sandbox/MainBundle/Resources/views/MultilangStaticContent/index.html.twig">templates</a>.
              The image upload is now actually functional and all the CMF Bundles and libraries have been updated
              to their respective latest versions. Finally we are now using the <a href="https://github.com/lunetics/LocaleBundle">LuneticsLocaleBundle</a>
              as the language switcher. To be able to use such a general purpose Bundle, build around the
              <a href="https://github.com/symfony/Routing">static routing</a> component of Symfony2 core, with our
              <a href="https://github.com/symfony-cmf/Routing">dynamic routing</a> component marks a major step in ensuring
              that the development experience with the CMF remains as simple and predictable as with just Symfony2 itself.
              In this context we are also pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ezp-next/blob/master/composer.json#L33">eZPublish5></a>
              will ship using our routing component. Drupal is also <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1606794">in the process</a>
              of adopting it for their upcoming Drupal 8 release.

              The Symfony CMF documentation is now part of the official documentation of Symfony2 itself. The new location
              is <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/master/cmf/index.html">here</a>. Looks much better now, but the still need help in getting
              the documentation into a state where they can really take a beginner and turn them into a CMF expert.
              The while current state touches on pretty much all aspects of the CMF, there is a lot of room of improvement
              in terms of language, details and introducing each concept in the right order. This is the kind of thing
              that is really hard for the original authors to get right, since they tend to be oblivious to such aspects.

            <p>The last few months have seen a huge increase of activity on the CMF (we seem to not have written many news, but those following the github projects will have seen it). Both Jackalope and PHPCR-ODM and the CMF bundles got new features and tons of issues fixed. And the documentation is starting to take shape, but can still use a lot of improvement.</p>
            <p>With all this activity, it will be hard to draw the line for a 1.0 release, but nonetheless we need to do it. We built a <a href="https://github.com/symfony-cmf/symfony-cmf/wiki/Release-1.0">release plan</a> that wants to stabilize from the bottom up. We start with PHPCR and phpcr-utils, then go to Jackalope and its transports, then the Doctrine PHPCR-ODM and finally the Symfony2 CMF bundles. We created milestones in the PHPCR / Jackalope / PHPCR-ODM space for now. We hope to get through them until beginning of April, and should probably start version 1.0 milestones for the Symfony2 bundles mid of March and focus on the needed pieces in April.</p>
            <p>The scope of features we get will depend on the contributions by everybody. But on the other hand, there is no problem adding new features soon afterwards and frequently tagging new versions - as long as we do not need to break backwards compatibility. One important focus is thus to tackle those problems that could require BC breaks so we can get them over before going to a stable release.</p>

            <p>As you might have noticed, we reached a phase in the stabilization process where we clean up things and try avoid future architecture problems. This leads to lots of BC breaks (and we don't want to clutter the codebase with legacy support before a version 1.0 is even out).</p>
            <p>We now created a set of alpha tags for all relevant bundles. If you want to stay at the edge and don't mind adjusting to the occasional BC break, please keep using 1.0.* and report any issues. Otherwise, you can pin to the following versions to keep status quo and update the tags manually when you want a new feature.</p>

            <p>If you where depending on symfony-cmf/symfony-cmf you need to add the individual bundles for now, sorry. This will all get better once we have stable releases. Then we will not do BC breaks without updating the minor version, so that you can safely depend on 1.0.*.</p>
            <p>Note that the RoutingExtraBundle was renamed to RoutingBundle. There is 1.0.1 of RoutingExtraBundle which will be the last version with the old name. The above tagged versions already use the new RoutingBundle name. RoutingBundle master branch is already called 1.1 now. It dropped Symfony 2.1 support.</p>

                <p>
                The <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a> Content Management
                Framework project was started by a large group of Symfony developers looking
                to get an early start on collaborating together for the next generation
                of PHP Content Management Systems built on top of Symfony2. Several companies
                and developers have dedicated themselves to the project. Some of the companies
                can be found below. Please feel invited to join the effort with or without
                the backing of a company behind you:
